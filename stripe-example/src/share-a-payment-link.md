# Share a Payment Link

Share payment links across social media, emails, or your website. After you create a payment link, share it with your customers to accept payments without a digital storefront.

## Share Your Link

Use the Dashboard to copy your payment link, and share it online. Click the copy icon next to an existing link on the Payment Links page, or go to the payment link’s details page. You can share your payment link multiple times and anywhere online, including:

- Emails
- Text messages
- Social media platforms

## Generate a QR Code

You can create a QR code for a payment link in the Dashboard. Choose an existing link from the Payment Links page, or create a new link and then click QR code. Copy or download a PNG image of the QR code.

The QR code doesn’t expire. If you deactivate the underlying payment link, the QR code redirects to an expiration page.

## Embed a Button on Your Site

Turn your payment link into an embeddable buy button to sell a product or subscription from your website. Select an existing link from the Payment Links page or create a new link and then click Buy button. Copy the code and paste it into your website. To learn more on how to embed and customize a button, see [Create a buy button](https://stripe.com/docs/payment-links/create-a-buy-button).

## Deactivate a Link

You can use the Dashboard to deactivate a payment link. Click the overflow menu () to the right of the desired payment link, and then Deactivate. After you deactivate a link, customers are no longer able to make a purchase using it. You can choose to reactivate the payment link at any time. You can also use the API to deactivate a payment link.
